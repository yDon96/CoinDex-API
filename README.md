## Introduction

Welcome to CoinDex API, your ultimate companion for organizing and categorizing 
your coin collection effortlessly! \
Whether you're a numismatist, a collector, or just someone intrigued by coins, CoinDex API is here 
to simplify the process of identifying and categorizing your coins with just a snap.

---
## Motivation

While manual cataloging and categorizing served as the foundation 
for coin collection management, this process could be extremely **time-consuming, prone to error 
and difficult to update**.


---
## Quick Start

### 1. Setup the project

Open your terminal, then run the following command to install dependencies for the project:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set env file

Copy the example [.env file](./.env), and set the needed values:
```bash
cp .env .env.dev
```

> Note: Change 'dev' with 'production' or 'test' for new environment.

### 3. Let's run it!

```bash
npm run dev
```

---
## Documentation

I utilize Swagger for documenting the API endpoints, 
providing a clear and interactive way for developers to understand 
the functionalities and data models of our system.

Once your project is running, open a web browser and navigate to the Swagger UI URL. This URL is:

```
https://<domain>/docs
```


---
## Docker

### 1. Create the image
Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory 
containing your Dockerfile, and run the following command:
```bash
docker build -t <image-name> .    
```

### 2. Start a new container

Once the image is built, you can run it using the following command:
```bash
docker run -it -p 3000:3000 -e [env-var-list] <image-name>       
```

Use _**'-e'**_ to specify all the required environment variable. (See [here](./.env))
