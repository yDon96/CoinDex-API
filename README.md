## Introduction

Welcome to CoinDex API, your ultimate companion for organizing and categorizing 
your coin collection effortlessly! \
Whether you're a numismatist, a collector, or just someone intrigued by coins, CoinDex API is here 
to simplify the process of identifying and categorizing your coins with just a snap.

---
## Motivation

While manual cataloging and categorizing served as the foundation 
for coin collection management, this process could be extremely **time-consuming, prone to error 
and difficult to update**.


---
## Quick Start

### 1. Setup the project

Open your terminal, then run the following command to install dependencies for the project:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set env file

Copy the example .env file, and set the needed values:
```bash
cp .env .env.dev
```

> Note: Change 'dev' with 'production' or 'test' for new environment.

### 3. Let's run it!

```bash
npm run dev
```
